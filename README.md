# rvt-rs

**Apache-2.0 Rust/Python toolkit for inspecting Autodesk Revit files (`.rvt`, `.rfa`, `.rte`, `.rft`) without a Revit installation.** Opens the OLE/CFB container, decodes Revit's truncated-gzip streams, extracts metadata and previews, parses the embedded `Formats/Latest` schema, and classifies all observed schema field encodings across an 11-release 2016–2026 reference corpus.

This distribution also includes an opt-in native saved-record/world-model path
alongside the legacy walker/exporter. The native commands are
`rvt-native-document`, `rvt-native-record-probe`, `rvt-native-scene`, `rvt-native-equipment`,
`rvt-native-world-model`, `rvt-native-revision-diff`,
`rvt-native-saved-scene`, `rvt-native-network`, and `rvt-native-package`.

The native path provides bounded JSON and GLB projections for supported saved
records, spatial context, relationships, parameters, materials, lifecycle
state, revisions, and graphics. Unsupported records, relationships, versions,
and geometry remain diagnostics or explicit refusals. It does not claim
universal typed-model recovery or drop-in IFC conversion. Legacy glTF output
omits unsupported geometry with diagnostics instead of fabricating placeholder
meshes.

See the [native format reference](docs/research/native-format-reference.md),
[native projection status](docs/native-provenance.md), and [native world-model
capability](docs/native-world-model-research.md). Multi-loop/non-rectangular
curved trims, full regeneration, visibility parity, and render parity remain
unproven.

We have generated and analyzed many Revit files to discern the file structure and variation.

**This is not yet a full Revit model reader.** Schema-directed instance walking has a verified `ADocument` beachhead on Revit 2024–2026 (document-level metadata only — not per-element), and `Formats/Latest` schema classification covers 100% of observed field encodings. IFC4 STEP emission produces a valid spatial tree with typed elements **when fed synthesized `DecodedElement` inputs from the test fixtures** — see `tests/fixtures/synthetic-project.ifc`.

**Generic real-project typed element extraction is mostly unsolved**, with narrow partition MVP exceptions. Production `walker::iter_elements` prefers typed MVP decoders on `Global/Latest` (fail closed), merges version-gated 2023 ArcWall partition recovers, and merges fail-closed partition MVP recovers for Level / Material / Room / Floor plan-loops plus 2024 ArcWallRectOpening index rows (corpus-proven on magnetar Einhoven / Core Interior). Opening related ids are ElemTable-confirmed (still not typed Door/Window). On Revit 2024 it additionally merges partition *element records*, whose header names the element's `BuiltInCategory` outright: `OST_Walls` / `OST_Doors` / `OST_Windows` / `OST_Columns` records that carry no container reference and are marked placed instances reproduce Revit's own exported ElementId sets exactly — 360 `IfcWall`, 132 `IfcDoor`, 6 `IfcWindow`, 256 `IfcColumn` on `2024_Core_Interior.rvt`, tolerance 0, cross-witness gated (#204 / #211, `reports/element-framing/RE-21-partition-element-record-instance-rule.md`). Bodies are the record's bounding box, except for the plan profile of a slab, which is the sketch boundary its `OST_SketchLines` records close (#31, `reports/element-framing/RE-25-slab-plan-profiles.md`), and the plan run of a wall, which is the box cut back by its joins — 336 of 360 walls then match Revit's world envelope exactly, up from 27, and every column carries the section its family type declares (#215, `reports/element-framing/RE-26-world-coordinate-residuals.md`). Doors and windows are bound to their host wall (#222, RE-23); schema-field Walls remain open — diagnostic scans still find `HostObjAttr`-style candidates on `Global/Latest` for those classes. **81** per-class decoder structs ship in `elements::all_decoders()`; `MVP_TYPED_CLASSES` are consulted by `iter_elements`, while the broader registry remains a library building block. Root-cause investigation (`reports/element-framing/RE-01-synthesis.md`) found that element instance data lives in `Partitions/*` streams with a wire envelope that has only been reverse-engineered for ArcWall (2023) and opening-index (2024) subsets. Q-01 community-corpus open/scaffold validation has been run (`docs/corpus-hunt-2026-04-21.md`: 222/223 real files pass open → schema → scaffold IFC); that is not full typed model recovery. See [What does not work yet](#what-does-not-work-yet) below.

The Level, Material, Room, and Floor plan-loop observations described above
are historical diagnostic findings; unbound candidates are not promoted by the
current production walker.

**A zero-upload, client-side browser viewer ships alongside the library**, live at <https://drunkonjava.github.io/rvt-rs/>. Drop a `.rvt` / `.rfa` file onto the page — the WebAssembly build parses it in-tab, renders 3D via Three.js with orbit controls + element picking + scene tree, and offers one-click **Export glTF** / **Export IFC** / **Export plan SVG**. No upload, no account, no telemetry. CI asserts the compiled `.wasm` has zero `fetch` / `XMLHttpRequest` / `WebSocket` imports.

For the non-technical workflow, start with the [`docs/user-guide.md`](docs/user-guide.md). Installation paths live in [`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md). For the short support boundary, read [`docs/status.md`](docs/status.md), the supported MVP input profile in [`docs/supported-profile.md`](docs/supported-profile.md), and the executable capability matrix in [`docs/support-matrix.json`](docs/support-matrix.json) (statuses are honest ceilings, not converter-grade claims). The detailed roadmap tasks live in [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) and the matching GitHub milestones/issues.

Rust 2024 edition (MSRV 1.85). **Twenty-seven CLIs ship** (`rvt-analyze`, `rvt-info`, `rvt-inspect`, `rvt-schema`, `rvt-history`, `rvt-diff`, `rvt-corpus`, `rvt-dump`, `rvt-doc`, `rvt-ifc`, `rvt-ifc-compare`, `gen-fixture`, `rvt-write`, `rvt-gltf`, `rvt-sheet`, `rvt-elem-table`, `rvt-elements`, `rvt-capabilities`, `rvt-native-scene`, `rvt-native-document`, `rvt-native-record-probe`, `rvt-native-equipment`, `rvt-native-world-model`, `rvt-native-revision-diff`, `rvt-native-saved-scene`, `rvt-native-network`, `rvt-native-package`) plus 36 reproducible probes under `examples/`. Python bindings via pyo3+maturin in the `rvt-py` workspace member (SEC-12/13 — the core `rvt` crate is unconditionally `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`) — `pip install rvt`.

| Cross-release tag-drift table | ✓ | First public 122×11 dataset |
| Layer 5a ADocument walker | partial | Reliable on Revit 2024–2026; 2016–2023 entry-point detection pending |
| Stream-level modifying writer | ✓ | 13/13 streams byte-preserving; `rvt-write` CLI + JSON patch manifests |
| Field-level semantic writer | pending | Gated by [ADR-002](docs/decisions/ADR-002-semantic-write-api-gate.md); no stable API until decoder/validation evidence is strong enough |
| Layer 5b per-class decoders | partial | **81 decoder structs exist in `elements::all_decoders()`**. Production `iter_elements` prefers typed decode for `MVP_TYPED_CLASSES` on `Global/Latest` and merges validated ArcWall partition records (2023). Schema-driven Wall/Floor/Door/Window/Level from arbitrary partitions remains open (RE-01). |
| IFC4 STEP export — spatial tree | ✓ | `IfcProject` + `IfcSite` + `IfcBuilding` + `IfcBuildingStorey` + OmniClass classifications |
| IFC4 STEP export — elements | partial | `IfcWall`/`IfcSlab`/`IfcRoof`/`IfcCovering`/`IfcDoor`/`IfcWindow`/`IfcColumn`/`IfcBeam`/`IfcStair`/`IfcRailing`/`IfcFurniture`/`IfcFooting`/`IfcReinforcingBar`/`IfcSpace`/`IfcBuildingElementProxy` constructors all emit correctly **from synthesized `DecodedElement` inputs** (`tests/fixtures/synthetic-project.ifc` is one such output, 10 typed elements, BlenderBIM verified). On real project files the walker currently only recovers `HostObjAttr` (a parent class) so the exporter emits `IFCBUILDINGELEMENTPROXY` proxies rather than typed walls/doors. Getting typed elements out of real files requires the wire-format breakthrough described in RE-01 synthesis. |
| IFC4 STEP export — geometry | ✓ (rectangular) | `IfcExtrudedAreaSolid` + `IfcRectangleProfileDef` chain wired to the element's Representation slot. Rectangular profiles only (curved doors, non-orthogonal walls still pending — IFC-17/24). |
| IFC4 STEP export — materials | ✓ | Single-material via `IfcMaterial` + `IfcRelAssociatesMaterial`; compound assemblies via `IfcMaterialLayerSet` + `IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage` (IFC-28/29). Walls / floors / roofs with layered composition emit correctly. |
| IFC4 STEP export — properties | ✓ | `IfcPropertySet` + `IfcPropertySingleValue` with typed values (`IfcText`, `IfcInteger`, `IfcReal`, `IfcBoolean`, `IfcLengthMeasure`, `IfcPlaneAngleMeasure`, `IfcAreaMeasure`, `IfcVolumeMeasure`, `IfcCountMeasure`, `IfcTimeMeasure`, `IfcMassMeasure`) wired via `IfcRelDefinesByProperties`. |
| IFC4 STEP export — openings | ✓ | `IfcOpeningElement` + `IfcRelVoidsElement` + `IfcRelFillsElement` — doors and windows cut actual holes in their host walls (BlenderBIM verified). |
| Geometry extraction | partial | Extrusion helpers ship for walls/slabs/roofs/ceilings/columns/beams/stairs/doors/windows (GEO-27..35, IFC-16..26). Swept / revolved / BRep variants exist (IFC-17/18/19/20) but with `rvt` feature-flagged rectangular fallbacks in the default emission path. |
| glTF 2.0 binary export | ✓ | `model_to_glb()` produces a valid `.glb` file that loads in Three.js's `GLTFLoader` (VW1-04). `rvt-gltf` CLI. |
| 2D plan-view SVG export | ✓ | `render_plan_svg()` produces per-category-coloured SVG (walls black, doors blue, columns red, …) (VW1-11). `rvt-sheet` CLI. |
| Browser viewer | ✓ | Live at <https://drunkonjava.github.io/rvt-rs/>. WebAssembly build of the core library + Three.js + Vite. Zero-upload, in-tab parse, Export glTF/IFC/SVG buttons, URL-based share via `share::ViewerState`. (VW1-01 through VW1-24 shipped.) |
| Fuzz-regression harness | ✓ | 9 libFuzzer targets + 38 synthetic adversarial regression cases under `tests/fuzz_regressions.rs`. Caught a real `gzip_header_len` bounds bug on 9-byte truncated headers (Q-04). |

## What does not work yet

| Gap | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Element extraction from real `.rvt` project files | **partial** | ArcWall (2023) + partition MVP Level/Material/Room (+ Floor plan-loops where no element records decode) + 2024 ArcWallRectOpening index + 2024 partition element-record Wall/Door/Window/Column/Floor/BuildingPad instances (exact ElementId sets vs Revit's own export, #204/#211/#212) merge into production `iter_elements`. Opening related ids are ElemTable-confirmed (not Door/Window). All 80 exported slabs also carry the plan profile their `OST_SketchLines` records close (#31/RE-25); wall bodies are cut back by their joins and columns carry their family type's section (#215/RE-26). Doors and windows are bound to their host wall (#222/RE-23); schema-field Walls remain unsolved. Production path filters HostObjAttr; diagnostic API retains broad candidates. See `reports/element-framing/RE-01-synthesis.md`. |
| 81 per-class decoders wired into walker | partial | `MVP_TYPED_CLASSES` are preferred via typed decoders in `iter_elements` (fail closed). The remaining registry entries still use generic `decode_instance`. ArcWall uses a separate partition decoder. |
| IFC4 typed elements from real `.rvt` | unsolved (narrow research exception) | Default export is scaffold / diagnostics. `RvtDocExporter::export` may emit version-gated 2023 ArcWall `IFCWALL` records when evidence is strong enough; that path is not general typed conversion. Doors/floors/windows and geometry remain unproven on arbitrary real project files. |
| Community corpus open/scaffold verification | executed (scaffold only) | `tools/fetch-corpus.sh` + `examples/probe_corpus_batch_validate.rs` reported **222/223** real files passing open → schema → scaffold IFC (`docs/corpus-hunt-2026-04-21.md`). That measures container/schema/scaffold health, not typed element extraction. |
| Partition-stream wire format | not reverse-engineered | 12 RE probes in `examples/probe_*` tested five hypotheses; all refuted. `Global/ContentDocuments` identified as a structured index but its id space does not match `ElemTable`'s (6/30705 overlap). Blocker on element extraction. |
| Scalar-Container wire format on real bytes | assumption only | L5B-09 fix assumes Vector-equivalent layout for kinds 0x01/0x02/0x04/0x05/0x07/0x0b/0x0d. Round-trip tests use synthesized bytes; no real-.rvt round-trip has been exercised. Tracked as WF-01..03. |
| Patched CFB roundtrip for grow/shrink cases | covered | Family corpus tests cover identity, grow, shrink, multi-stream, and missing-stream patches; project-corpus tests cover identity/grow/shrink/multi while preserving unpatched streams plus GUID/history. |

The Level, Material, Room, and Floor plan-loop entries in this historical table
are diagnostic-only observations; current production output requires ownership
evidence.

## Why the schema matters

The openBIM community — anchored by [buildingSMART International](https://www.buildingsmart.org/) and the IFC standard — has spent years working on Revit interoperability. Autodesk's own [revit-ifc](https://github.com/Autodesk/revit-ifc) exporter runs **inside** Revit using the Revit API, so it can only emit what the API surfaces. Real-world IFC exports from Revit are described, routinely and publicly, as *"very limited"* (thinkmoult.com), *"data loss"* (Reddit r/bim), and *"out of the box, just crap"* (the [OSArch Wiki's guide to Revit for openBIM](https://wiki.osarch.org/index.php?title=Revit_setup_for_OpenBIM)).

The schema work here — decoding `Formats/Latest` and classifying 100% of field encodings across 11 Revit releases — is the dictionary a byte-level reader needs. Once the partition-stream decoder work in [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) lands, the resulting IFC export can carry more than what the Revit API chooses to expose. That is the thesis. It is not yet the delivered product.

If you're building BIM/AEC tooling and want an Apache-2 Revit reader to compose into your stack, the current release covers:

- **Reliably** — metadata extraction, schema introspection (100% field-type classification across the 11-release family corpus), OLE/CFB open, truncated-gzip decode, IFC4 STEP emission from synthesized inputs, glTF 2.0 binary, 2D plan-view SVG, 81 per-class decoder structs that pass unit tests against synthesized fixtures.

- **As scaffolding, not functional on real project files yet** — broad diagnostic element scans and walker→IFC integration. Production export now suppresses low-confidence `HostObjAttr` proxies and only emits the narrow, version-gated 2023 ArcWall path when it is supported by corpus evidence (see "What does not work yet" above).

See [`tests/fixtures/synthetic-project.ifc`](tests/fixtures/synthetic-project.ifc) for a committed sample IFC output — `IfcProject` + `IfcSite` + `IfcBuilding` + three `IfcBuildingStorey`s + ten typed `IfcWall`/`IfcSlab`/`IfcDoor`/`IfcWindow`/`IfcStair`/`IfcBuildingElementProxy` entities, all wired to the storey via `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure`, BlenderBIM- and IfcOpenShell-verified. The browser viewer at <https://drunkonjava.github.io/rvt-rs/> runs the same IFC emission pipeline — so drag-and-drop a .rvt and the resulting Export IFC produces the metadata/spatial scaffold (not typed elements) end-to-end in the tab.

## Quick demo

One command produces the full forensic picture — identity, upgrade history, format anchors, schema table, Phase D link histogram, content metadata, and a disclosure scan:

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/rvt-analyze --redact path/to/your.rfa
```

### From Python

```python
import rvt

f = rvt.RevitFile("my-project.rfa")
print(f.version, f.part_atom_title)      # 2024 "0610 x 0915mm"
print(f.read_adocument()["fields"][-1])  # {name: m_devBranchInfo, kind: element_id, tag: 0, id: 35}
open("out.ifc", "w").write(f.write_ifc())
```

Install: `pip install rvt` — or build from source with [`maturin build --release --manifest-path rvt-py/Cargo.toml`](docs/python.md#from-source). Full API + Jupyter notebook walkthrough: [`docs/python.md`](docs/python.md) and [`docs/rvt-python-quickstart.ipynb`](docs/rvt-python-quickstart.ipynb).
See [`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md) for cargo, PyPI, source, and viewer
install/smoke-test paths.

### In the browser

Drop a `.rvt` / `.rfa` / `.rte` / `.rft` at <https://drunkonjava.github.io/rvt-rs/> — nothing leaves the tab. The viewer compiles the core library to WebAssembly (`wasm-pack build --target web --features wasm`), runs the parse in a dedicated worker, and renders 3D via Three.js. One-click buttons export the model as **glTF 2.0 binary**, **IFC4 STEP**, or **plan-view SVG**. URL state (camera pose + category filters) is shareable via the hash fragment.

The landing dropzone also includes a **demo gallery** staged from [`docs/viewer-demos.json`](docs/viewer-demos.json) (license/provenance + expected quality labels). Demo bytes are same-origin static assets only.

Privacy posture is CI-enforced: the deploy workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-viewer.yml`) runs `wasm-objdump -j Import` on every build and fails if the compiled `.wasm` imports `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, or `WebSocket`. See [`docs/viewer-privacy-posture.md`](docs/viewer-privacy-posture.md).

### Supported MVP workflow

The supported end-to-end shell (issue M11-02) is intentionally honest about partial decode:

1. Open a supported Revit file locally (drop, file picker, or a redistributable gallery demo).
2. Read the File status / confidence panel before trusting geometry.
3. Inspect decoded entities in the scene tree or by picking in the 3-D view.
4. Export IFC / glTF / plan only after checking the export-quality label.
5. Download diagnostics when the export is scaffold-only or partial.

What still depends on decoder / partition-stream work: schema-field Walls, typed Door/Window host IFC, Level ElementId storey assignment for Rooms, door and window bodies, and compound wall layers (slab thickness, plan profile and Floor↔ElemTable id binding are closed for the record-backed slab set, #212/#31; wall thickness and the join-trimmed run are closed for the record-backed wall set, #215/RE-26). Partition MVP already recovers Level / Material / Room / Floor plan-loop names (and 2023 ArcWall geometry on the research path). **RE-19 / RE-20 (2026-08-29) closed negative** on magnetar corpora — no Door vs Window discriminator *in the opening-index bytes*, no schema-field/2024 Wall envelope, and no recoverable Level ElementId map — so stop re-probing those ids until new corpus or signals appear. RE-21 / RE-22 (2026-08-30) are a **different carrier** and do not re-open them: the partition element record names the `BuiltInCategory` itself, and the per-element IFC export-type override is a parameter string, not an opening-index or schema-field signal. Treat IFC export as scaffold-plus-diagnostics except on the narrow version-gated paths in [`docs/status.md`](docs/status.md) and [`docs/supported-profile.md`](docs/supported-profile.md).

**Sample output** (all pre-scrubbed with `--redact`, committed for review):

- **One-screen teaser**: [`docs/demo/rvt-analyze-2024-teaser.txt`](docs/demo/rvt-analyze-2024-teaser.txt) — the four highlight sections fit in one terminal screen (identity, format anchors, Phase D linkage, disclosure scan)
- **Full terminal report**: [`docs/demo/rvt-analyze-2024-redacted.txt`](docs/demo/rvt-analyze-2024-redacted.txt) — 130 lines of structured output
- **JSON report**:    [`docs/demo/rvt-analyze-2024-redacted.json`](docs/demo/rvt-analyze-2024-redacted.json) — machine-readable version
- **Tag-drift heatmap**: [`docs/data/tag-drift-heatmap.svg`](docs/data/tag-drift-heatmap.svg) — visual proof of class-ID drift across 11 Revit releases

The `--redact` flag (on by default in every committed artifact) scrubs Windows usernames, Autodesk-internal paths, and project-ID folder names to `<redacted>` markers while preserving path shape so claims remain verifiable. Omit the flag when running privately against your own files.

## Results at a glance

Running the shipped CLIs against one 400 KB RFA fixture:

- **Metadata**: version, build tag, creator path, file GUID, locale (`rvt-info`)
- **Atom XML**: title, OmniClass code, taxonomies (`rvt-info` parses `PartAtom`)
- **Preview**: clean PNG thumbnail, 300-byte Revit wrapper stripped (`rvt-info --extract-preview`)
- **Schema**: 395 classes + 1,114 fields + per-field typed encoding (`rvt-schema`)
- **History**: every Revit release that ever saved this file (`rvt-history`)
- **Bulk strings**: 3,746 length-prefixed UTF-16LE records from Partitions/NN — Autodesk unit/spec/parameter-group identifiers, OmniClass + Uniformat codes, Revit category labels, localized format strings (`rvt-history --partitions`)

Every class and field name that `rvt-schema` extracts was cross-checked against the public `RevitAPI.dll` NuGet package's exported C++ symbol list. All top-level tagged class names we've inspected (ADocument, DBView, HostObj, LoadBCBase, Symbol, APIAppInfo, APropertyDouble3, ElementId, and the rest) appear in that export with their decorated signatures (e.g. `__cdecl NotNull<class ADocument *,void>::NotNull(class ADocument *)`), confirming the on-disk schema names match the compiled symbols one-to-one.

A build-server path also appears in C++ assertion strings inside the same DLL; it is mentioned in the recon report for completeness and does not represent anything the reader extracts from .rvt / .rfa files.

## Phase D findings (what makes this project different)

Six reproducible discoveries, all documented in [`docs/rvt-moat-break-reconnaissance.md`](docs/rvt-moat-break-reconnaissance.md) and reproducible from `examples/`:

1. **The schema indexes the data.** Class names do not appear as ASCII in `Global/Latest`; class tags from `Formats/Latest` (u16 after class name, with 0x8000 flag set) occur ~340× the uniform-random rate. The top tag, `AbsCurveGStep`, appears 19,415 times in 938 KB of decompressed Global/Latest. [`examples/link_schema.rs`]

2. **Tags drift across releases** but are stable-sort-assigned. `ADocWarnings` = 0x001b 2016→2026 because no class sorted alphabetically before it has ever been added. `AbsCurveGStep` shifted 0x0053 → 0x0066 across the decade as 19 new A-class entries were inserted. Full 122-class × 11-release drift table: [`docs/data/tag-drift-2016-2026.csv`](docs/data/tag-drift-2016-2026.csv), visualised in [`docs/data/tag-drift-heatmap.svg`](docs/data/tag-drift-heatmap.svg). First publicly-available version of this data. [`examples/tag_drift.rs`]

3. **Revit 2021 was a major undocumented format transition.** Global/Latest grew 27× (~26 KB → ~715 KB) while simultaneously the Forge Design Data Schema namespaces (`autodesk.unit.*`, `autodesk.spec.*`) debuted in Partitions/NN. Two symptoms, one event. Any reader built for 2016-2020 silently drops 30× more data when pointed at 2021+.

4. **Parameter-group namespace shipped separately in Revit 2024.** `autodesk.parameter.group.*` identifiers appear in 2024+ only — three releases after units/specs. Dating the Forge schema rollout from on-disk bytes: [`examples/tag_drift.rs`](examples/tag_drift.rs), [`src/object_graph.rs`](src/object_graph.rs).

5. **A stable Revit format-identifier GUID in family files.** `Global/PartitionTable` is 167 bytes decompressed in `.rfa` family files, and **165 of those bytes are byte-for-byte identical across every Revit release 2016-2026** (98.8% invariant). The invariant region contains a never-before-published UUIDv1: `3529342d-e51e-11d4-92d8-0000863f27ad`. The MAC suffix `0000863f27ad` matches a known Autodesk-dev-workstation signature from circa 2000. Useful for family-file detection. **Scope correction (2026-04-21):** this invariant is a *family-file* anchor, not a universal Revit-file anchor. Three real `.rvt` project files we probed carry three different GUIDs (`6a6261fd-...` on Revit 2023, `552368c6-...` on 2024, all-zero on 2025) in a shorter 87-byte `PartitionTable`. File-type sniffers using the family GUID will correctly reject non-family files but can't identify them. See [`docs/project-file-corpus-probe-2026-04-21.md`](docs/project-file-corpus-probe-2026-04-21.md). [`examples/partition_full.rs`]

6. **Tagged class record structure decoded.** Every class declaration in `Formats/Latest` carries an explicit tag (u16 with 0x8000 flag), optional parent class, and declared field count, followed by N field records each with name + C++ type encoding. `HostObjAttr` now resolves to `{tag=107, parent=Symbol, declared_field_count=3}` with all three field names (`m_symbolInfo`, `m_renderStyleId`, `m_previewElemId`) extracted byte-for-byte. [`examples/record_framing.rs`, `src/formats.rs`]

Three unintended disclosure patterns also surfaced in Autodesk's shipped reference content — the specific values are withheld from this README to avoid re-broadcasting them; they are documented in [`docs/rvt-moat-break-reconnaissance.md`](docs/rvt-moat-break-reconnaissance.md) for security-research reproducibility:

- A customer-facing OneDrive path that leaks the directory structure of an Autodesk employee's personal sample-authoring workflow.
- A build-server path baked into C++ assertion strings inside the public `RevitAPI.dll`.
- A creator-name field inside the `Contents` stream that travels with every copy of the sample family, preserving the name of one of Revit's original 1997 developers.

**Downstream safety:** the `rvt-analyze` CLI ships with a `--redact` flag (on by default for any of the committed demo output in this repo) that rewrites creator paths, Autodesk-internal paths, and build-server paths to `<redacted>` markers while preserving the surrounding structure. Any tool consuming rvt-rs output and displaying it publicly should do the same.

## Library surface

All modules compile under both the default build and the `wasm` feature flag. See `src/` for type docs:

Runtime capabilities:

- Open any Revit file from disk (magic `D0 CF 11 E0 A1 B1 1A E1`)
- Enumerate every OLE stream; find the version-specific `Partitions/NN`
- Decompress any stream (truncated-gzip format — standard gzip header, no trailing CRC/ISIZE)
- Parse `BasicFileInfo`, `PartAtom`, extract preview PNG
- Extract **395 class records** from `Formats/Latest` with tag + parent + ancestor-tag + declared field count for every tagged class
- Decode the 167-byte `Global/PartitionTable` structure including the stable Revit format-identifier GUID
- Decode the 307-byte `Contents` stream including the embedded UTF-16LE metadata chunk
- Produce a byte-for-byte round-trip copy of any `.rfa` / `.rvt` file
- Run across the full 11-release corpus in < 500 ms per file (release build)

## Format overview

Every Revit file is a Microsoft Compound File Binary (OLE2) container with
this stream layout (constant across 11 years of Revit releases):

```
<root>
├── BasicFileInfo                 UTF-16LE metadata
├── Contents                      custom 4-byte header + DEFLATE body
├── Formats/Latest                DEFLATE — class schema inventory
├── Global/
│   ├── ContentDocuments          tiny document list
│   ├── DocumentIncrementTable    DEFLATE — change tracking
│   ├── ElemTable                 DEFLATE — element ID index
│   ├── History                   DEFLATE — edit history (GUIDs)
│   ├── Latest                    DEFLATE — current object state (17:1 ratio)
│   └── PartitionTable            DEFLATE — partition metadata
├── PartAtom                      plain XML (Atom + Autodesk partatom namespace)
├── Partitions/NN                 bulk data: 5-10 concatenated DEFLATE segments
│                                 NN = 58, 60-69 for Revit 2016-2026
├── RevitPreview4.0               custom header + PNG thumbnail
└── TransmissionData              UTF-16LE transmission metadata
```

All compressed streams use a "truncated gzip" format — the standard 10-byte
gzip header (magic `1F 8B 08 ...`) followed by raw DEFLATE, but *without*
the trailing 8-byte CRC32 + ISIZE that conforming gzip writers produce.
Python's `gzip.GzipFile` and Rust's `flate2::read::GzDecoder` both refuse
these streams. The fix is to skip the 10-byte header manually and use
`flate2::read::DeflateDecoder` on the raw body.

## Reverse engineering state

| Layer | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 · Container | OLE2 / Microsoft Compound File ([MS-CFB]) | **Done** |
| 2 · Compression | Truncated gzip → raw DEFLATE | **Done** |
| 3 · Stream framing | Per-stream custom headers, `Partitions/NN` chunk layout, `Contents` / `Preview` / `PartitionTable` wrappers | **Done** — 165/167 bytes of `PartitionTable` invariant; 44-byte `Partitions/NN` header decoded; `62 19 22 05` wrapper magic confirmed on `Contents` + `RevitPreview4.0` |
| 4a · Schema table | Class names + fields + C++ type signatures from `Formats/Latest`; per-class tag + parent + declared field count; cross-release tag-drift map | **Done** |
| 4b · Schema→data link | Tags from `Formats/Latest` occur at ~340× the noise rate in `Global/Latest`; schema IS the live type dictionary for the object graph | **Done** |
| 4c.1 · Record framing | Tagged class records in `Formats/Latest` parse into structured records: `{tag, parent, ancestor_tag, declared_field_count}`; HostObjAttr → `{tag=107, parent=Symbol, ancestor_tag=0x0025 → APIVSTAMacroElem, declared_field_count=3}` | **Done** |
| 4c.2 · Field-body decoding | `FieldType` enum classifies **100%** of schema fields across 8 variants (Primitive, String, Guid, ElementId, ElementIdRef, Pointer, Vector, Container). 11 discriminator bytes mapped, including generalized scalar-base Vector/Container (`{kind} 0x10 ...` / `{kind} 0x50 ...`) and the `0x0d` point-type base. | **Done (100.00% on 13,570 fields across the 11-version corpus; zero `Unknown`)** |
| 4d · ElemTable | `Global/ElemTable` header parser + rough record enumeration; record semantics remain unresolved pending per-element schema lookup | **Partial** |
| 5 · IFC4 export | Full spatial tree + per-element IFC entities + `IfcLocalPlacement` + `IfcExtrudedAreaSolid` + compound material layers + typed property sets + `IfcOpeningElement`/`IfcRelVoidsElement`/`IfcRelFillsElement` for doors and windows. Deterministic ISO-10303-21 output. IfcOpenShell + BlenderBIM verified. | **Done** (rectangular profiles; swept / revolved / BRep fallbacks ship but use rectangular in the default emission path — IFC-17/24 is the remaining refinement) |
| 6 · Write path | Byte-preserving copy for unchanged files; stream-level patching for named OLE streams with atomic temp-file rename, per-stream verification, grow/shrink/multi-stream coverage, and GUID/history preservation checks. Field-level semantic patching is Phase 7. | **Done (stream-level); field-level pending** |
| 7 · Browser viewer | WebAssembly build of the core + Three.js + Vite + Pages deploy. Zero-upload, in-tab parse, export buttons for glTF/IFC/SVG, URL-state share. Live at <https://drunkonjava.github.io/rvt-rs/>. | **Done** (VW1-01..24) |

All 5 original P0 research questions (Q4-Q7) are **resolved**. Layer 4c.2 reaches **100.00% field-type classification** on the 11-version reference corpus (13,570 total schema fields, zero `Unknown`). IFC4 emission, glTF export, 2D plan view, and the browser viewer all ship. The next frontier is real-world project-file corpus validation (Q-01) — one `.rvt` probe already caught a `gzip_header_len` bounds bug that family files never hit.

Key findings from this phase:

- **Q4** The u16 "flag" word in each tagged-class preamble is a **class-tag reference** (ancestor / mixin / protocol). 9/9 non-zero values resolve to named classes in the same schema.
- **Q5** Each field's `type_encoding` is `[byte category][u16 sub_type][optional body]`. 9 category bytes mapped (`0x01` bool, `0x02` u16, `0x04/0x05` u32, `0x06` f32, `0x07` f64, `0x08` string, `0x09` GUID, `0x0b` u64, `0x0e` reference/container).
- **Q5.1** Coverage extended to 84% of fields.
- **Q5.2** Coverage reaches **100%** of fields (13,570 across 11 releases). Generalized `{scalar_base} 0x10 ...` / `{scalar_base} 0x50 ...` as vector/container modifiers; added `0x0d` point-type base; added `0x08 0x60 ...` alternate string encoding; added `ElementIdRef { referenced_tag, sub }` for references that carry a specific target-class tag; added deprecated `0x03` i32-alias seen only in 2016–2018. See `docs/rvt-moat-break-reconnaissance.md` §Q5.2.
- **Q6** `Global/Latest` is **not** an index + heap — it's a flat TLV stream.
- **Q6.1** Instance data is **schema-directed** (tag-less, protobuf-style). Decoding requires schema-first sequential walk from a known entry point.
- **Q7** `Partitions/NN` trailer u32 fields are **not** per-chunk offsets. Gzip-magic scan remains correct.

The full analysis narrative with 12 dated addenda lives in [`docs/rvt-moat-break-reconnaissance.md`](docs/rvt-moat-break-reconnaissance.md). Session-length synthesis in [`docs/rvt-phase4c-session-2026-04-19.md`](docs/rvt-phase4c-session-2026-04-19.md).

## Sample corpus

Integration tests run against 11 versions of Autodesk's public
`rac_basic_sample_family` RFA fixture (one per Revit release from 2016
through 2026). These are distributed via Git LFS in the `phi-ag/rvt`
repository. To pull them:

```bash
cd /path/to/rvt-recon/samples
git clone https://github.com/phi-ag/rvt.git _phiag
cd _phiag && git lfs pull
cd .. && cp _phiag/examples/Autodesk/*.rfa .
```

The integration tests in `tests/samples.rs` skip any year whose RFA file
is absent, so partial corpora are okay — you'll just see
`skipping 2024: sample not present` messages.

## Design choices

- **cfb crate over custom OLE parser** — the `cfb` crate is mature,
  tested against Office documents, and handles both short and regular
  sectors. Faster than writing our own.
- **flate2 over miniz_oxide direct** — `flate2` wraps both `miniz_oxide`
  (pure Rust) and libz backends. We pick the default pure-Rust build to
  avoid a C toolchain dependency.
- **quick-xml over xml-rs** — ~3x faster, zero-copy friendly, and the
  `.from_str` + event-loop pattern is closer to what Go/Python parsers do.
- **encoding_rs over stdlib** — Revit's UTF-16LE streams sometimes have
  malformed pairs at boundaries (single-byte markers get interleaved).
  `encoding_rs` recovers gracefully where stdlib panics.
- **BTreeSet for class names** — deterministic ordering in output (plus
  sorted JSON) matters for diffable CLI output.

## For contributors

rvt-rs is a clean-room reader for Revit files: an Apache-2.0 Rust core with
Python bindings and a WebAssembly viewer, with no Revit install or Autodesk
SDK at build or run time. Contributing does not need private files either —
the checked-in `corpus/tier1/` synthetic fixtures drive the default gates, and
corpus-backed tests skip themselves while `RVT_PROJECT_CORPUS_DIR` is unset.

- **Build:** stable Rust 1.85 or newer, then `cargo build`. Viewer:
  `cd viewer && npm ci`. Python bindings: [`docs/python.md`](docs/python.md).
- **Gate:** `tools/check-local.sh` runs what CI requires — `cargo fmt --check`,
  `cargo clippy -D warnings`, rustdoc with `-D warnings`, and the workspace
  tests (1,074 as of 2026-08-30). `--viewer`, `--corpus`, `--deny`, `--audit`
  add the optional gates.
- **Where the tests live:** unit tests next to the code in `src/`; integration
  tests in `tests/` (corpus-gated ones skip without `RVT_PROJECT_CORPUS_DIR`);
  `tests/fuzz_regressions.rs` replays crash-shaped inputs on stable Rust;
  libFuzzer targets in `fuzz/`; Playwright browser tests in `viewer/tests/`;
  Python tests in `tests/python/`.
- **What "done" looks like:** the gate is green, the pull-request template's
  checklist is filled in, and any change to user-visible capability updates
  [`docs/status.md`](docs/status.md) and
  [`docs/support-matrix.json`](docs/support-matrix.json) in the same PR — the
  project does not claim what its tests cannot show.
- **Start here:** [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) walks from clone to a
  first pull request; [`docs/contribution-map.md`](docs/contribution-map.md)
  maps the larger areas; small tasks carry the
  [good first issue](https://github.com/DrunkOnJava/rvt-rs/labels/good%20first%20issue)
  label.
